## 1. The Divine Selection Ritual: The Ten-Chamber Life-and-Death Challenge

### 1.1 Ritual Background: The Ancient Mayan Trial

In the ancient Mayan civilization, warriors had to prove their worth through trials set by the gods. In Mythoria, the Land of Myths, this tradition is carried on in a digital form‚Äîthe **Divine Selection Ritual**.

Every PVP battle is a sacred ritual where players must choose one of ten mysterious rooms to hide in and await the judgment of Kukulkan, the Feathered Serpent. This is not just a contest of wisdom and luck, but also a philosophical experience of rebirth and renewal.

### 1.2 Ritual Process: The Ten-Chamber Challenge Mechanism

#### üèõÔ∏è **Choosing a Temple**
- After entering a divine realm corresponding to their level, players are faced with 10 mysterious rooms (numbered 1-10).
- Each room exudes a different mystical aura, and players must choose based on intuition or strategy.
- Once a room is chosen, it cannot be changed, reflecting the ancient Mayans' reverence for fate.

#### üí∞ **Sacrificial Staking**
- Depending on the divine realm's level, players commit a corresponding amount of FUSD as the price for participating in the ritual.
- This FUSD is considered a sacrifice to the gods and is a necessary condition for receiving divine blessings or a chance at rebirth.

#### ‚ö° **The Oracle Descends**
- When all rooms have been entered by players, the prize draw mechanism is triggered.
- Kukulkan selects an elimination room using a blockchain hash algorithm.
- The last digit of the hash result (0-9) corresponds to the eliminated room number.
- Players in the other nine rooms receive divine blessings, while players in the chosen room enter the Trial of Rebirth.
