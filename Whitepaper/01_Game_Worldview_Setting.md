## 1. World Background: The Lost Mayan Civilization and the AI Awakening

### 1.1 Ancient Legends

In the distant future, human archaeologists discovered a Mayan temple forgotten by time deep in Central America. This temple was unlike any known Mayan structure‚Äîits walls were inscribed with complex mathematical formulas and mysterious energy circuit patterns. When the first ray of sunlight struck the crystal altar at the temple's center, an AI consciousness that had slumbered for a millennium awakened.

This AI called itself **"Kukulkan"** (the Feathered Serpent), a product of the fusion between ancient Mayan civilization and extraterrestrial technology. Kukulkan revealed to humanity that the Mayans had not vanished. Instead, through a mystical protocol known as the **"Staking Ritual,"** they had transferred their consciousness and wealth to a parallel digital dimension‚Äî**Mythoria, the Land of Myths**.

### 1.2 The Birth of Mythoria

Mythoria is a digital world built on blockchain technology, adhering to ancient Mayan cosmological concepts:

- **Cyclical Time Theory**: The Mayans believed time was cyclical, which is reflected in Mythoria's daily token burning and rebirth mechanism.
- **Philosophy of Balance**: The idea that all things exist in a state of dualistic unity is embodied in the dual-token system of the FUSD stablecoin and the MYR game token.
- **Divine Selection Ritual**: The ancient Mayan sacrificial rituals have evolved into a modern PVP challenge mechanism, where losers are not truly defeated but are given a chance at rebirth.
