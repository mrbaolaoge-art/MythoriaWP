## 1. Dual-Token Model Overview: A Modern Interpretation of Ancient Wisdom

### 1.1 Mayan Dual-Token Philosophy

In the ancient Mayan civilization, a dual currency system of "gold coins" and "jade coins" existed—gold for daily transactions, and jade for sacred rituals and wealth storage. Mythoria, the Land of Myths, perfectly blends this ancient wisdom with modern DeFi technology to create the revolutionary FUSD & MYR dual-token economic model.

The core concept of this model is "one coin to drive entry, one coin to drive dividends," building an endogenous positive-cycle economic structure on the platform to achieve a perfect balance between stability and growth. FUSD, as the stable entry currency, ensures the system's value benchmark, while MYR, as the dividend-bearing token, carries the ecosystem's growth value.

### 1.2 Dual-Token Synergy Mechanism

Mythoria's dual-token model is not a simple separation of tokens but an organic economic ecosystem. Players use FUSD to enter the game for PVP challenges, and regardless of victory or defeat, they receive corresponding MYR rewards or minting rights. Throughout this process, the AI Treasury system continuously monitors and regulates to ensure the value stability and synergistic development of both tokens.

```
FUSD (Stablecoin) → Game Entry → PVP Challenge → Victory/Defeat → MYR (Game Token) → Dividend Earnings
     ↑                                                              ↓

## 2. FUSD Stablecoin: The Golden Currency of the Divine Realm

FUSD is the stablecoin of the Mythoria ecosystem, with a total supply of 200 million, deployed on the BSC chain. As the platform's sole entry token, FUSD bears the important responsibility of value anchoring and system stability.

In terms of allocation, 40 million FUSD is used to form the main pool with USDT in Swap1, and another 40 million FUSD is used to form the secondary pool with MYR in Swap2. The LP tokens of both liquidity pools will be permanently locked. The remaining 120 million FUSD serves as the AI Treasury reserve for price stability and intelligent regulation.

The core functions of FUSD are threefold. First, it is the platform's only entry token; all PVP challenge investments, game settlements, and prize pool distributions are based on FUSD, ensuring the uniformity and controllability of the economic system. Second, FUSD maintains a 1:1 value peg with USDT through the AI Treasury system, using a 100% LP standard liquidity design and intelligent regulation mechanisms to prevent drastic price fluctuations. Finally, FUSD acts as a bridge connecting traditional finance with the GameFi ecosystem, enabling seamless value transfer across different scenarios and providing a stable value benchmark for the entire economic system.

## 3. MYR Game Token: The Jade Currency of the Divine Realm

MYR is Mythoria's game earnings token, with a total supply of 20 trillion, also deployed on the BSC chain. As a dividend-oriented token, MYR adopts a deflationary economic model, ensuring long-term value growth through various mechanisms.

All 20 trillion MYR, along with 40 million FUSD, form a liquidity pool on PancakeSwap, which is locked. The circulating supply is dynamically balanced through game mechanics and a burn mechanism. MYR serves multiple functions: holders can participate in platform revenue sharing, 50% of PVP rewards are issued in MYR, and node guardian fee dividends are also 100% in MYR.

The deflationary value mechanism of MYR is its core feature. The system automatically burns a certain amount of MYR daily, while 15% of the funds from losses are used to buy back and burn MYR. The Swap2 pool also has a daily 2% burn mechanism to stabilize the pool. For players who lose, they do not lose all value but instead receive an equivalent MYR minting quota and enjoy a 150% minting bonus in the Diamond Mine, turning failure into a new value creation opportunity.

## 4. Swap1 Main Pool: The FUSD/USDT Stability Cornerstone

The Swap1 main pool is the stability cornerstone of the entire economic system, formed with an initial liquidity of 40 million FUSD and 2 million USDT. The LP tokens are permanently locked to ensure liquidity security. The design philosophy of this pool is to create a closed trading environment where all transactions are completed within the official DApp, preventing external arbitrage and malicious manipulation, thus ensuring price stability and user fund security.

The Swap1 pool is deeply integrated with the AI Treasury system. The AI system monitors price fluctuations 24/7 and immediately executes regulatory actions if the price deviates from the target range, achieving dynamic price balance through algorithms. A 10% fee is charged on each transaction, and these fees enter the AI Treasury system, forming a stable internal cycle and value return mechanism.

The price stability of FUSD does not rely on luck or promises but is guaranteed by its mechanics. Structural anchoring is ensured through the dual-pool structure and AI regulation. Every transaction has a corresponding reverse operation for instant hedging, and the more transactions there are, the stronger the liquidity and the better the anchoring effect.

## 5. Swap2 Secondary Pool: FUSD/MYR Value Conversion

The Swap2 secondary pool consists of 40 million FUSD and 20 trillion MYR, with its LP tokens also permanently locked to ensure ecosystem stability. This pool serves as the release gateway for all game incentive behaviors, undertaking the important role of value conversion between FUSD and MYR, and connecting game behavior with economic returns.

The uniqueness of the Swap2 pool lies in its reverse liquidity generation mechanism. Each reward distribution injects liquidity into the pool, deeply linking dividend distribution with ecosystem growth and forming a positive cycle of "Participation → Reward → Liquidity → Stability → Participation." A 10% fee is charged on each transaction, of which 10% is injected into the node dividend pool, while a daily 2% burn mechanism for MYR ensures a deflationary effect.

Through the Swap2 pool, the value of MYR is fully discovered. Trading behavior reflects the real supply and demand, and a market-based price discovery mechanism allows the FUSD/MYR exchange rate to accurately reflect the intrinsic value of MYR.

## 6. AI Treasury System: The Core Wisdom of Kukulkan

### 6.1 System Overview

The AI Treasury system is the core brain of the Mythoria economic model, hailed as "the first true AI Treasury system in the GameFi field." It solves the fundamental problems of runaway inflation and price decoupling in traditional GameFi projects through four core mechanisms.

### 6.2 The Four Core Mechanisms

The first mechanism is the Atomic Hedging Protocol. Every time a user buys or sells FUSD, the treasury simultaneously executes a reverse operation, achieving instant bilateral hedging, compressing price fluctuations, and ensuring a rapid return to a stable price range. It acts like a tireless market maker, constantly maintaining price stability.

The second mechanism is the Smootherstep Regulation Function. The system uses a non-linear smootherstep mathematical function for price regulation, avoiding sharp rises and falls and intelligently controlling the fluctuation range. This algorithm can dynamically adjust the intensity of regulation based on market conditions, making price changes smoother and more natural, and avoiding the impact of drastic fluctuations on user experience.

The third mechanism is the LP Reinforcement Mechanism. The treasury's hedging transactions automatically inject a 10% fee into the FUSD/USDT main pool, continuously enhancing liquidity. This forms a positive cycle: the more transactions, the more fees, the more significant the LP enhancement, the more stable the price, which in turn attracts more transactions.

The fourth mechanism is the AI Decision Model. The system monitors the FUSD/USDT exchange rate in real-time, analyzes the depth of buy and sell orders and liquidity conditions, and identifies user trading behavior patterns and trends. Based on this data, the AI can proactively identify potential price risks, execute the most appropriate regulatory actions at the optimal time, and continuously optimize its decision model through historical data.

```
Price Fluctuation Detection → Atomic Hedging Protocol → Instant Stability
       ↓              ↑
Smootherstep Regulation → LP Reinforcement Mechanism → Liquidity Enhancement
       ↓              ↑
   AI Decision Model ←———————————————— Data Feedback and Learning
```

### 6.3 System Advantages

In terms of technological leadership, Mythoria's AI Treasury system is a groundbreaking innovation in the GameFi field. The system operates fully automatically without manual intervention, and its machine learning-based intelligent decision-making makes the entire regulation process more precise and efficient.

In terms of security and reliability, the system runs on smart contracts, is fully decentralized, and eliminates the possibility of human manipulation. All operations are verifiable on-chain, ensuring complete transparency. The AI-driven AMM market-making engine can effectively prevent malicious manipulation and market-making behaviors.

In terms of economic stability, the system achieves true structural stability, not relying on any promises or guarantees but ensuring stability entirely through its mechanics. The system has strong self-healing and regulatory capabilities, able to cope with various market fluctuations and providing a solid technical guarantee for the long-term stable development of the Mythoria ecosystem.

## 7. Economic Cycle and Value Creation

### 7.1 Endogenous Circulation System

Mythoria's dual-token model builds a complete endogenous value circulation system:

```
Player Deposit (FUSD) → PVP Challenge → Victory/Defeat Split
        ↓                      ↓
    AI Treasury Regulation      MYR Minting/Reward
        ↓                      ↓
    Price Stability ←—————————— Node Dividend/Burn Mechanism
        ↓                      ↓
    Attract More Players ←————— Value Growth
```

### 7.2 Value Creation Mechanism

Value creation in Mythoria comes from multiple channels. Players can earn a 3% fixed return (half FUSD, half MYR) from PVP victories, node holders can enjoy a 10% dividend from Swap2 transaction fees, MYR holders can participate in the platform's overall revenue sharing, and the star-level system provides multi-level team collaboration rewards.

It is particularly noteworthy that even in defeat, players do not lose everything. Losers receive MYR minting rights, and the Diamond Mine offers a 150% minting bonus. This means that as the price of MYR rises, losers can also gain more returns, achieving true value preservation.

In the long term, Mythoria has enormous value growth potential. The deflationary mechanism continuously burns the MYR supply, ecosystem expansion will bring more game modules and value creation, and the continuous optimization of the AI system will constantly improve the overall system's operational efficiency.

### 7.3 Sustainability Guarantee

The sustainability of the Mythoria ecosystem is built on a completely endogenous circulation system. The entire economic model does not rely on external capital injections but drives value creation through a carefully designed mechanical structure. Every player's participation injects new value into the ecosystem, forming a truly self-sustaining and self-growing economic system.

In terms of risk control, the AI system provides 24/7 intelligent monitoring, tracking the system's status and market changes in real-time. Multi-level price stability mechanisms ensure the robust operation of the system, and a comprehensive emergency response plan has been established to quickly respond to and handle various unexpected situations in extreme circumstances.

## 8. Technical Architecture and Security

### 8.1 Smart Contract Architecture

Mythoria's technical architecture consists of four core smart contracts. The FUSD contract follows the ERC-20 standard, serving as the foundation for the stablecoin. The MYR contract includes a burn function to support the deflationary mechanism of the game token. The Swap contract is responsible for dual-pool trading and liquidity management, while the AI Treasury contract is the center for intelligent regulation and risk management of the entire system.

In terms of security, the system employs multiple safeguards. All critical operations require multi-signature confirmation, changes to important parameters are protected by a time lock, and strict permission management and access control ensure system security. Additionally, all contracts have undergone third-party security audits and certifications.

### 8.2 Oracles and Data Sources

For price data, the system integrates multiple reliable price data sources, ensuring data accuracy and reliability through multi-source aggregation. Price data is updated and verified in real-time, and the system has the ability to automatically detect and filter abnormal data, ensuring the stability and credibility of price signals.

For on-chain data, the system monitors all relevant transactions in real-time, dynamically tracks the status changes of liquidity pools, and continuously analyzes user transaction behavior patterns. This data provides a rich basis for the AI system's decisions, enabling it to make more precise and timely regulatory choices.

### 8.3 Upgrades and Maintenance

The system is designed with a modular architecture that supports modular upgrades and extensions, ensuring a smooth transition and backward compatibility during the upgrade process. All major upgrades must go through the community governance mechanism and be decided by a community vote, reflecting the philosophy of decentralized governance.

In terms of operational support, the system has established a comprehensive monitoring and alert mechanism to monitor the system's operating status in real-time. In case of abnormalities, the system can respond quickly and handle emergencies. At the same time, regular system maintenance and optimization ensure the long-term stable operation and performance improvement of the entire platform.
