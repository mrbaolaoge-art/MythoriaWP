## 1. The Divine Selection Ritual: Core Gameplay of the Ten-Chamber Challenge

### 1.1 Room Battle Mechanism

Mythoria's core gameplay, the "Divine Selection Ritual," uses an innovative ten-chamber challenge model. Each game round includes ten mysterious rooms, and players must choose one to hide in. Once all rooms are filled, the system triggers the prize draw mechanism, randomly generating a winning number from 0-9 using a blockchain hash algorithm. This corresponds to eliminating one room, and the players in the remaining nine rooms win.

This design ensures a high win rate of 90%, allowing more players to have a positive earning experience, while the 10% chance of failure maintains the game's economic balance. Eliminated players do not suffer a complete loss; instead, they enter the "Diamond Mine" and receive 150% MYR minting rights, turning failure into a new value creation opportunity.

### 1.2 Match Tier System

To meet the needs of players with different investment capacities and risk appetites, Mythoria has designed six different levels of challenge matches:

```
Experience Field (50 FUSD)  → Beginner-friendly, 2-minute draw
Training Field (100 FUSD) → Skill improvement, 2-minute draw
Novice Field (500 FUSD) → Advanced challenge, 2-minute draw
Apprentice Field (1,000 FUSD) → Professional level, 2-minute draw
Warrior Field (5,000 FUSD) → Advanced players, 2-minute draw
Elite Field (10,000 FUSD) → Top-tier challenge, 2-minute draw
```

All matches use a fast 2-minute draw mechanism to ensure a compact and exciting game pace. The investment amounts range from 50 FUSD to 10,000 FUSD, allowing players of different economic means to find a suitable way to participate.

## 2. Reward Distribution Mechanism: Gains for Both Winners and Losers

### 2.1 Winner's Reward System

Winning players receive a fixed 3% dividend return. This percentage has been calculated through a precise economic model to provide sufficient incentive while maintaining the system's sustainability. The reward is distributed as 50% FUSD + 50% MYR, ensuring that players receive both stable value returns and can participate in the long-term appreciation of the MYR token.

The reward release uses a linear unlocking mechanism with a standard release period of 12 hours. However, players can shorten this release time by increasing their star level, down to as fast as 2 hours. This design encourages long-term participation in the ecosystem's construction, providing a better liquidity experience through star-level growth.

### 2.2 Loser's Value Conversion

The funds invested by losing players do not simply disappear. Instead, they are transformed and recycled through a carefully designed distribution mechanism:

**Fund Allocation Structure**:
- **15%** - Buyback and Burn MYR: Buys back MYR tokens in the Swap2 pool and sends them to a black hole address to be burned, directly reducing the MYR supply and promoting token deflation.
- **35%** - Star-Level Rewards: Distributed to 1-star to 10-star users, with differentiated allocation based on star level and team contribution.
- **10%** - Direct Referral Commission: Rewards for referrers, incentivizing community promotion and user growth.
- **27%** - Winner's Reward: The source of the winning players' 3% return, ensuring the sustainability of the rewards.
- **3%** - 10-Star Global Bonus: Evenly distributed among all 10-star users, reflecting the special rights of top-tier users.
- **5%** - Official Tax: Used for project operations, technical development, and ecosystem construction.
- **5%** - Team Peer Bonus: 1% allocated to each of the C6-C10 tiers, incentivizing team collaboration.

### 2.3 MYR Minting Rights Mechanism

Losing players receive an equivalent MYR minting quota, which is Mythoria's unique "failure-to-value conversion" mechanism. In the Diamond Mine, losers enjoy a 150% minting bonus, meaning that if they lose a 1,000 FUSD investment, they can receive MYR minting rights worth 1,500 FUSD.

As the price of the MYR token rises, the actual value of these minting rights will also increase. For example, if the MYR price increases by 50%, the original 1,500 FUSD minting right would be worth 2,250 FUSD, allowing even losers to share in the ecosystem's growth dividends.

## 3. Star-Level Collaborative Growth System

### 3.1 Ten-Star Growth Model

Mythoria has built a complete 10-star community system, with levels based on personal and team transaction volumes. The higher the star level, the greater the incentive profit-sharing ratio, community influence, and global dividend distribution rights.

**Star Promotion Requirements**:

| Star Level | Personal Volume (FUSD) | Team Volume (FUSD) | PVP Reward Ratio |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-Star | 10,000 | 100,000 | 3.6% |
| 2-Star | 20,000 | 200,000 | 7.2% |
| 3-Star | 40,000 | 400,000 | 10.8% |
| 4-Star | 100,000 | 1,000,000 | 14.4% |
| 5-Star | 200,000 | 2,000,000 | 18.0% |
| 6-Star | 400,000 | 4,000,000 | 21.6% |
| 7-Star | 1,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 25.2% |
| 8-Star | 2,000,000 | 20,000,000 | 28.8% |
| 9-Star | 4,000,000 | 40,000,000 | 32.4% |
| 10-Star | 8,000,000 | 80,000,000 | 36.0% |

### 3.2 Team Earnings Calculation Logic

The star system's earnings are calculated based on the depth of team contributions, not relying on platform subsidies or centralized distribution. Here are examples of earning potential at different star levels:

**Earnings Calculation Example** (at different MYR exchange rates):

- **1-Star User**: Team volume of 100,000 FUSD, receives a 0.45% profit share = 450 FUSD
  - At an MYR exchange rate of 0.1: actual earnings of 45 USDT
  - At an MYR exchange rate of 0.2: actual earnings of 90 USDT

- **5-Star User**: Team volume of 2,000,000 FUSD, receives a 2.25% profit share = 45,000 FUSD
  - At an MYR exchange rate of 0.1: actual earnings of 4,500 USDT
  - At an MYR exchange rate of 0.2: actual earnings of 9,000 USDT

- **10-Star User**: Team volume of 80,000,000 FUSD, receives a 4.50% profit share = 3,600,000 FUSD
  - At an MYR exchange rate of 0.1: actual earnings of 360,000 USDT
  - At an MYR exchange rate of 0.2: actual earnings of 720,000 USDT

This design ensures that each star-level promotion is a leap in structural profit-sharing capability, not just a change in title.

## 4. Node Rights and Dividend Mechanism

### 4.1 Seven-Tier Node System

Mythoria offers seven tiers of Node NFTs, V1-V7, with a total of 1,700 available, serving as the core vehicle for ecosystem governance and revenue sharing. Node holders are entitled to dividends from Swap2 transaction fees, creating a stable source of passive income.

**Node Issuance Details**:

| Node Tier | Quantity Issued | Price (USDT) | Incentive Ratio | Payback Period |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| V1 | 500 | 1,000 | 1.0% | 41 days |
| V2 | 500 | 3,000 | 1.5% | 55 days |
| V3 | 300 | 6,000 | 1.5% | 55 days |
| V4 | 200 | 10,000 | 1.5% | 55 days |
| V5 | 100 | 18,000 | 1.5% | 55 days |
| V6 | 50 | 30,000 | 1.5% | 55 days |
| V7 | 50 | 50,000 | 1.5% | 55 days |

### 4.2 Dividend Distribution Mechanism

Node dividends are sourced from the 10% transaction fee of the Swap2 pool and are distributed using a weighted average method. Higher-tier node users not only receive dividends from their current tier's fee pool but can also participate in the dividend pools of all lower tiers, maximizing their returns.

**Dividend Calculation Formula**:
```
Node Dividend = (Number of users in the tier + Weighted number of users) / Total MYR from the current pool's transaction fees
```

Dividends are distributed in MYR tokens and are updated and allocated daily at UTC+0. This design reflects the scarcity value of "the higher the node tier, the fewer the people, the more concentrated the dividends," giving early participants a stronger earnings advantage.

## 5. Release Mechanism and Liquidity Management

### 5.1 Team Reward Release Rules

Team rewards are issued in a dual-token format, and an automatic exchange mechanism is triggered when the user claims them. For example, for a 1,000 FUSD team reward, the user will ultimately receive MYR equivalent to 450 FUSD + 405 FUSD, ensuring diversified returns and risk mitigation.

### 5.2 MYR Dynamic Release Mechanism

The release of MYR tokens uses an innovative dynamic adjustment model. The base release is a linear 1% daily, but users can earn an accelerated release quota based on their game activity:

**Accelerated Release Formula**:
```
Daily Accelerated Release Quota = Daily Game Volume × 10%
```

This design encourages users to remain active in the game, gaining better fund liquidity through participation and creating a positive incentive loop of "the more you participate, the faster it releases."

### 5.3 Node MYR Rewards

Node MYR rewards receive special treatment, being issued as 100% MYR and released immediately upon claim, without a waiting period. This reflects the special status and rights of node holders and provides additional liquidity value to the Node NFTs.

## 6. Risk Control and Balancing Mechanisms

### 6.1 Economic Model Equilibrium Points

Mythoria's PVP mechanism has been precisely mathematically modeled to ensure long-term economic balance:

- **90% win rate** ensures a positive experience for most players.
- **3% fixed return** provides a stable investment return expectation.
- **Multi-layer distribution mechanism** ensures effective circulation of funds within the ecosystem.
- **Deflationary burn mechanism** maintains the long-term value growth of the MYR token.

### 6.2 Anti-Cheating and Fairness Guarantees

The system uses a blockchain hash algorithm to generate random numbers, ensuring the absolute fairness and non-manipulability of the prize draw results. All game records and fund flows are transparent and verifiable on-chain, preventing any form of insider trading or human intervention.

### 6.3 Liquidity Risk Management

Through the tiered match design and the star-level growth system, the system can effectively mitigate the risk of large single investments. At the same time, through node dividends and team reward mechanisms, it ensures that users at all levels receive corresponding income guarantees.
